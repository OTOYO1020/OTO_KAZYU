Tempest needs to run against any deployment without knowing its config (and without parameterizing everything). From that test, I can poke the info API, asking which methods are enabled, which by default is all of them, even in situations where we _know_ that they cannot be used. Even worse, the API client will be told \"202: I'm working on this\" and then nothing will ever happen, not even failure will be reported. That seems like exceedingly broken API behavior to me.\n\nHow can we write a reliable tempest test against Glance's API when it tells us things will work that can't possibly work?",

I can arrange the test skip lists in CI such that all the jobs will run with the proper config or skip the test, that's not the problem.\n\nTempest is used by lots of people in their own environment for validation. If I am an operator and don't want (or care) to have the import functionality work, I may very much prefer to run glance-api under uwsgi, like all the other API services. In that case, I would not be able to run tempest against my deployment without a failure, or long timeout unless the test itself can detect that a function is not enabled. You could argue that they should \"just know\" that they need to disable the methods before running the test, or that tempest should have a conf knob to disable that test. I obviously think that if we're running in pure WSGI mode and *know* that the import methods can't work, we should refuse to expose that they do.\n\nMaybe you didn't see this, but devstack now deploys glance in standalone mode by default unless you *ask* for wsgi mode, separate from all the other services. So by default, import is testable in our CI.\n\nhttps://review.opendev.org/#/c/741258/\n\n > So far I still have enough integrity and some\n > respect towards QA to not do that.

Are you suggesting that glance stop supporting pure WSGI mode at all? If so, we should delete wsgi_app.py from the tree (or at least mark it as deprecated/unsupported).",

Also help operator to miss-configuration if they are in the impression that glance under wsgi with CONF.enabled_import_methods=True make import feature available for their users.\n\nFrom Tempest perspective, as dan mentioned, API telling if import is ready to use or not is best way instead of adding feature flag. If glance did not have /v2/info/import API then yes we can add feature flag in tempest side.",
