That's why I'd prefer to define them here as a declaration of what we intend to accomplish.  That doesn't mean that we need to work on max_import_size before the (harder) taskflow stuff.  But it would leave the non-implemented options as obvious bugs rather than something we *might* add to image import in a few cycles.  I see these as key features distinguishing image import from image upload, so I really have reservations about leaving them out.",

I thought the glance team had it well in hand and had settled on a minimal change that would provide an API meeting the needs for DefCore and users. The scope seems to have grown since that time, which is concerning because it is extremely important that this work be finished as soon as possible.\n\nThe copy-from-url case seems reasonable. I strongly encourage you to do that work after some DefCore-compatible version of the other import mechanisms is completely working and the tests are written to the DefCore team's criteria (although you shouldn't wait for them to actually adopt the tests). From a contributor community perspective getting *SOMETHING* DefCore can use is more important that deprecating any of the existing APIs which provide these \"deal breaker\" features. That will allow us to move ahead with the new work while maintaining support for the old APIs, deprecating them later (or even just deciding to continue to support them -- either way the decision and work is deferred).\n\nRegarding the confusion about the plan outside of the glance team, it would help greatly with communication if someone could write a short (very very short) description of how the API will work without getting into all of the details of exactly what is in each header or part of the request or response, but explaining how the calls are different (the spec on this is long, convoluted, and difficult for someone who is not already an expert in glance to understand at this point). For example, \"The client will use the discovery API to find out which upload/import mechanisms are enabled in a cloud. Then they will use the response to call the appropriate API methods to perform the upload/import the image in one of the supported ways. For method X, they will call endpoint A, providing...\". Please send that to the mailing list where it is easier to have a discussion like this.\n\nRegarding a default upload mechanism, we seem to be placing a lot of faith in security teams at different companies who all have different opinions about how uploading should work to be \"safe\". Rather than choosing upstream, where we don't really care as long as the feature is supported, I suggest that we just write the tests to require that one of the several mechanisms is available for uploading an image from outside of the cloud. We can have a separate test for each mechanism that \"skips\" if the mechanism is not actually enabled, unless *no*  mechanism is enabled in which case it should fail. If the mechanism to be tested is enabled, the test will only be handling one case so it can be written clearly without a bunch of branching. If the tests for direct, swift, and copy-from all also test that *some*  mechanism is enabled then we'll be able to ensure that all clouds provide the feature in some way without dictating what that is. The DefCore team can then figure out how to specify \"one of these N tests must pass\" (maybe they already have a way to do that, I don't know).",

The scope seems to have grown since that time, which is concerning because it is extremely important that this work be finished as soon as possible.\n\nFirstly, no issues Doug, I think we all do not expect you to participate in all the discussions. Also, I would not want the TC members thinking that Glance team does not have this in hand. Because, that is not really the case.\n\nThe very fact that you are saying that Glance team does not have this in hand is what is really disappointing. The entire purpose of my response was to indicate that we know what we are doing and there\u2019s good reference provided in there to indicate that. If anything, I think anyone who is not involved in Glance on regular basis need to make an informed review, decisions, communication when they want to hold back something. Please (I request you please) do not blame this on Glance. I think we\u2019ve had a fair share of bad publicity and to be fair none of that is our fault. All the development has been done publicly, all the API changes proposed as summit sessions and people have been provided an opportunity to provide feedback. It is really unfortunate that people have a strong say on how things should work post something is implemented or when it has been discussed on the spec and implementation is in progress.\n\nIt\u2019s a big failure for the OpenStack community, our review mechanism isn\u2019t either fair or efficient. Our communication on ML, emails, etherpads etc. isn\u2019t efficient and that results in a cultural habit of the same. We need to make informed reviews and decisions, always. And if we are not sure we need to ask the right questions that will not generate more speculation. \n\nIf you think I am proposing to slow down the proposal, then I should think I have failed miserably in communicating the intent \u2014 just to let you know I have been pushing for this to be done as a MVP  (something viable for DefCore) since Mitaka (just prior to elections, after elections & before summit, after the summit and now when I have a fair idea of how we are going to more forward on this.) Brian Rosmaita (as per his nod last week) and I are going to see this through (or I myself will see this through in Newton).  I have proposed a break down of the proposal as MVP (followed by everything else) at the summit. And to be honest, I feel the most pressure to get this done more than anyone else (due to many many reasons that people do not know).  If you think this is utter non-sense you can confirm with others (starting Brian).\n\nIn my defense, I had asked if we need to discuss this as a work session at the summit but the majority wins and it did not make it. Though I had asked people to join us for this discussion during the summit in the contributors\u2019 meet up where the team was preferring to discuss this. Also, I have pushed back the mid-cycle to June 15-17 (quite early in the cycle) just to make sure we are on the right track to get this done. Also, I am proposing for us to have more efficient channels of communication as I am really tired of the long discussions happening time after time, late, very very late. So, no offense to anyone it\u2019s not me who is blocking the progress.\n\nHaving said that, I think the end goal of any proposal should be that we have a successful cloud running OpenStack. When people vet their opinions that certain use cases are essential for them then I think it becomes important for us to consider them given OpenStack\u2019s mission statement is also about building massively scalable clouds https://governance.openstack.org/resolutions/20160106-mission-amendment.html?highlight=mission . \n\nHaving a trivial implementation is no way to move forward to support that case. Popularity of the use of the API is one aspect of implementing something, technically excellent is another end of the spectrum. We need to be empathetic about both the kind of APIs. \n\nI attempted my best to give a quick yet holistic response to how we need to move forward supporting both our needs going forward. It has been my experience that people are unwilling to budge after saying that is was discussed and we won\u2019t support it. So, the copy-from case becomes important to be brought up now and people know that it is a possibility (yes only a possibility of the future but not (anything less than possibility) say probability).\n\n\n> The copy-from-url case seems reasonable. I strongly encourage you to do that work after some DefCore-compatible version of the other import mechanisms is completely working and the tests are written to the DefCore team's criteria (although you shouldn't wait for them to actually adopt the tests). From a contributor community perspective getting *SOMETHING* DefCore can use is more important that deprecating any of the existing APIs which provide these \"deal breaker\" features. That will allow us to move ahead with the new work while maintaining support for the old APIs, deprecating them later (or even just deciding to continue to support them -- either way the decision and work is deferred).\n\nI cannot agree more than what you are saying. I have always been in the favor of not deprecating before (new) things are implemented but that trend seems to be going otherwise in OpenStack and I strongly dislike that. We need operational convenience before making deal breakers \u2014 even if it\u2019s supporting older APIs. So, +2 on that!\n\nThanks for being practical on the copy-from case, it appears to be equally popular case as the direct streaming to glance \u2014 because it\u2019s more asynchronous thus convenient. For large scale (in terms of number of uploads or in terms of larger uploads) I think it\u2019s more useful for a user to simply specify a url and wait for the import happens (a _more_ cloud friendly operation).\n\nI am not encouraging the copy-from case to be implemented before/in parallel to the DefCore capabilities. You can see in the spec that I have not asked for it as a part of the first Import Refactor implementation (as we can understand that it\u2019s about DefCore) the future discussion on how to support more can happen later. But at the same time, all the late push back on things makes is really difficult to ensure that your use cases are not heard for and people say you missed the train. That\u2019s not the right approach we need to take \u2014 hence if a point brought up earlier then better.\n\n\n> Regarding the confusion about the plan outside of the glance team, it would help greatly with communication if someone could write a short (very very short) description of how the API will work without getting into all of the details of exactly what is in each header or part of the request or response, but explaining how the calls are different (the spec on this is long, convoluted, and difficult for someone who is not already an expert in glance to understand at this point). For example, \"The client will use the discovery API to find out which upload/import mechanisms are enabled in a cloud. Then they will use the response to call the appropriate API methods to perform the upload/import the image in one of the supported ways. For method X, they will call endpoint A, providing...\". Please send that to the mailing list where it is easier to have a discussion like this.\n\n\nI am okay with the writing the description but it\u2019s a really sad part that we are planning to have this discussion after the spec is approved and we are at more than 7 months since this spec was first published. This has been my really worry and hence the subsequent response. I keep getting worried about the bad publicity Glance team keeps getting (for something that\u2019s not our fault) and the headers discussion that should really have been on the spec. Besides, there are other teams that are not using glance properly and leaks exist in the system \u2014 no one is willing to look (research) that way of how disastrous our implementations exists based on bad/wrong assumptions. I had to self-assign a research task to gather facts around the same. It seems like people want to target Glance team and I really hope that is not true. How can I be sure?\n\nWe are however okay to write a wiki (heck even a spec) where the discussion could happen in a sane manner and there\u2019s no bad intent communicated. When we are marching forward as fast as we can to get things implemented for DefCore, I hate to have another series of long ML discussions \u2014 that\u2019s not the efficient way to communicate things (at least when there are elements who want to target Glance) as per past experience.\n\n\n> Regarding a default upload mechanism, we seem to be placing a lot of faith in security teams at different companies who all have different opinions about how uploading should work to be \"safe\". Rather than choosing upstream, where we don't really care as long as the feature is supported, I suggest that we just write the tests to require that one of the several mechanisms is available for uploading an image from outside of the cloud. We can have a separate test for each mechanism that \"skips\" if the mechanism is not actually enabled, unless *no* mechanism is enabled in which case it should fail. If the mechanism to be tested is enabled, the test will only be handling one case so it can be written clearly without a bunch of branching. If the tests for direct, swift, and copy-from all also test that *some* mechanism is enabled then we'll be able to ensure that all clouds provide the feature in some way without dictating what that is. The DefCore team can then figure out how to specify \"one of these N tests must pass\" (maybe they already have a way to do that, I don't know).\n\nI think that sounds fair and again I echo that sentiment. It\u2019s a pain that there are many influencers in this effort who are not always coordinated. I have been on the same opinion that we need to pass at least one test for a particular import mechanism and if that passes then the interop branding can be given.\n\nAgain, I really want to have the most efficient communication where we are not repeating the same arguments again and that we are considering all elements of the OpenStack mission statement when implementing something ( https://governance.openstack.org/resolutions/20160106-mission-amendment.html?highlight=mission ).\n\nI have made the mid-cycle very early in the cycle, sent out the email to ML early too, am pushing Glancers to attend the same as far as possible (even if remotely) discuss Import. I\u2019ve come up with priorities that are not conflicting (not technically controvertial) with each other and enables different Glancers to keep themselves busy with just the right things (focus). I am encouraging other mediums of communication when appropriate and needed, expressing the intent where needed and very strongly encouraging for people to focus on MVP. I am keeping an eye on Glance ML emails and making sure we do not step ahead or step back of ourselves. \n\nLet me know how else I can be of assistance when it comes to communicating the right things. I am happy to do that as long as it helps us being \u201cunstuck\u201d.\n\nDanke!",

If folks have concerns about the suitability of the proposed API, and whether it is going to meet the DefCore needs that triggered this work in the beginning, having that feedback now is better than after code is in glance.

What I have been anticipating is a new API that sits in front of a bunch of existing features of Glance for which the API is either exposed poorly or not at all. Because I'm not intimately familiar with the existing glance code and feature set, I can't tell if that's what's being built, though, or if there are a bunch of new features being added in at the same time.\n\n > I attempted my best to give a quick yet holistic response to how we\n > need to move forward supporting both our needs going forward.

To be frank, the spec is the most convenient document and we were hoping for it to be something worth referring to or for asking questions if there are doubt on specific elements of it.

The end user facing API is pretty clean as you can see from the spec, there is no magic and it clearly states all the calls that need to be made to successfully import an image including the request body, response and the schema changes. So, the way Glance team think is that the spec clearly explains the approach we are taking with the API. We are hoping that people will read the spec and ask questions on the spec if something isn\u2019t clear or needs to be added before jumping to conclusions (something I hope isn\u2019t happening). I really want all those who are worried about this API to be involved in the syncs, and we will use non-glance language to ensure people can collaborate easily.
