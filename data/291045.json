They will give you feedback and may require you to refine it.\n\n    People seldom get their patch approved on the first try, so don't be\n    concerned if requested to make corrections. Feel free to modify your patch\n    and resubmit a new change-set.\n\n    Patches usually take 3 to 7 days to be reviewed so be patient and be\n    available on IRC to ask and answer questions about your work. Also it\n    takes generally at least a couple of weeks for cores to get around to\n    reviewing code. The more you participate in the community the more\n    rewarding it is for you. You may also notice that the more you get to know\n    people and get to be known, the faster your patches will be reviewed and\n    eventually approved. Get to know others and become known by doing code\n    reviews: anybody can do it, and it's a great way to learn the code base.\n\n    Thanks again for supporting OpenStack, we look forward to working with you.\n\n    IRC: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/IRC\n    Workflow: http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html\n    Commit Messages: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages",
